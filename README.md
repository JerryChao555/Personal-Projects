# Personal-Projects


1) The K-NN County Classifier was created by myself and a partner. We tested out some basic algorithms before settling on K-NN. 



2) The Kaggle PetFinder Project was done by a group of four team members. I was responsible for the EDA portion and shared my results with the other members so that they could complete the project.
