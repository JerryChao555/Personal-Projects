# Personal-Projects


1) The K-NN County Classifier was created by myself and a partner. We tested out some basic algorithms before settling on K-NN. 

2) The Kaggle PetFinder Project was done by a group of four team members. I was responsible for the EDA portion and shared my results with the other members so that they could complete the project.   

3) The Concha Labs Consulting Project was done by a group of seven team members. I was responsible for some basic initial EDA, the initial simulations code, and the XGBoost model.
